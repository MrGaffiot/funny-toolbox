Some funny stuff

## How to install???
1) Install latest python (https://www.python.org/)
2) Get the .zip fiel from relase
3) Run this command while in the src directory:
```
python setup.py install
```

## How to use??
Either run 
```
fools
```
or
```
afools
```
fools is a bit more fancy, it'll show the logo and the commands (there'll be a kind of promopt thingy when you run fools), while afools is just a normal lame command line application (you just run afools COMMAND, no prompt no nothing).

### rename
